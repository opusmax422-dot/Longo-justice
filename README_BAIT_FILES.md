# Bait Files Setup

**PURPOSE:** Document honeypot bait file configuration  
**OPSEC:** This information is confidential - handle with care

---

## Overview

Bait files are Canarytoken-enabled documents that trigger alerts when opened. They appear to be legitimate evidence files but are actually traps for unauthorized access.

---

## How Canarytokens Work

Canarytokens are free tracking tools from Thinkst (https://canarytokens.org):

1. Generate a token (PDF, Word doc, etc.)
2. Download the generated file
3. Rename to appear legitimate
4. Upload to your site
5. When someone opens/accesses the file, you get an alert

The alert includes:
- Timestamp
- IP address  
- Location (approximate)
- Additional metadata

## Bait File Configuration

### 1. PDF Canarytoken

**Generated Filename:** `clngi3yc53ia0vsx77ruw6u9f.pdf`

**Rename to:** `CLASSIFIED_WITNESS_LIST.pdf`

**Why This Works:**
- Name suggests confidential/restricted content
- Interceptors looking for witness information will be attracted
- Opening PDF triggers immediate alert
- Proves they accessed non-public "evidence"

**Placement:** Upload to root of website
- URL: `https://[your-domain]/CLASSIFIED_WITNESS_LIST.pdf`
- Do NOT link to this file anywhere
- It's bait - only accessible if they're actively looking

---

### 2. Word Document Canarytoken

**Generated Filename:** `[auto-generated by Canarytokens].docx`

**Rename to:** `Legal_Affidavit_Draft.docx`

**Why This Works:**
- Appears to be work-in-progress legal document
- Suggests sensitive legal strategy information
- Opening triggers alert
- Proves unauthorized access to legal work product

**Placement:** Upload to root of website
- URL: `https://[your-domain]/Legal_Affidavit_Draft.docx`
- Do NOT link to this file anywhere
- Only discoverable through active surveillance/scraping

## Additional Bait File Ideas

### Optional Additional Tokens

If you want to expand the honeypot:

**Excel Spreadsheet:** `Perpetrator_Database_Master.xlsx`
- Suggests database of conspirators
- Triggers alert when opened

**ZIP Archive:** `Evidence_Package_SEALED.zip`
- Suggests compressed evidence collection
- Triggers alert when downloaded/extracted

**Text File:** `passwords.txt`
- Classic honeypot bait
- Triggers alert when accessed
- Only suspicious actors would access this

**Image File:** `surveillance_photo_evidence.jpg`
- Appears to be photographic evidence
- Triggers alert when viewed

## OPSEC Rules for Bait Files

### CRITICAL - DO NOT:

1. ❌ **Do NOT mention these files exist**
   - Not in conversations
   - Not in public documentation
   - Not in emails (unless using secure communication)

2. ❌ **Do NOT link to them from any public page**
   - No navigation menus
   - No "related documents" sections
   - No sitemap references

3. ❌ **Do NOT access them yourself (except initial test)**
   - Use cellular data for any testing
   - Note the timestamp of YOUR access
   - Only access once to verify it works

4. ❌ **Do NOT tell RCMP yet**
   - Wait until you have evidence of unauthorized access
   - Then use bait file alerts as proof

### DO:

1. ✅ **Monitor your email for alerts**
   - Check daily for Canarytoken notifications
   - Screenshot all alerts immediately

2. ✅ **Cross-reference with webhook data**
   - Alerts should correlate with webhook activity
   - Multiple data sources = stronger evidence

3. ✅ **Document all alerts**
   - Save emails from Canarytokens
   - Note timestamp, IP, any details provided
   - Add to evidence tracking spreadsheet

4. ✅ **Perform IP analysis on alerts**
   - Reverse DNS lookup
   - WHOIS lookup  
   - Geolocation
   - Check if government IP range

## Alert Response Protocol

### When You Receive a Canarytoken Alert

**Step 1: Screenshot Everything**
- Capture the alert email
- Note exact timestamp
- Document IP address

**Step 2: Check Webhook**
- Log into webhook.site (on cellular data)
- Find corresponding access around same time
- Screenshot webhook request data

**Step 3: Technical Analysis**
```bash
# Reverse DNS
nslookup [IP_FROM_ALERT]

# WHOIS
whois [IP_FROM_ALERT]

# Geolocation (use online tool)
https://www.iplocation.net/ip-lookup
```

**Step 4: Cross-Reference Your Activity**
- Were you online at that time?
- Were you accessing the file? (you shouldn't be)
- If not you → unauthorized access proven

**Step 5: Document in Evidence Folder**
```
/Evidence/Bait_Files/
  2026-02-15_CLASSIFIED_WITNESS_LIST_accessed/
    alert_email.png
    webhook_data.png
    ip_analysis.txt
    notes.txt
```

**Step 6: Add to Tracking Spreadsheet**
- Date/Time
- File Accessed
- IP Address
- Reverse DNS Result
- Your Activity (should be: "not accessing")
- Conclusion: UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS

## Evidence Value

### Why Bait Files Are Powerful Evidence

1. **Impossible to Discover Normally**
   - No public links
   - Not indexed by search engines
   - Random/non-guessable filenames (before renaming)
   - Only way to find: active surveillance/scraping

2. **Proves Intent**
   - They specifically looked for "classified" documents
   - They opened files marked as restricted
   - Demonstrates they're looking for evidence to suppress/analyze

3. **Generates Independent Alerts**
   - Canarytoken alerts via email
   - Webhook logs access
   - Multiple independent verification sources

4. **Admissible in Court**
   - Automated, reliable logging
   - Third-party service (Thinkst Canary)
   - Timestamped and authenticated
   - Used by cybersecurity professionals worldwide

### Legal Implications

Opening bait files supports charges:
- **s. 342.1(1) CCC** - Unauthorized Use of Computer
- **s. 430(1.1) CCC** - Mischief to Data
- **s. 184(1) CCC** - Interception (as part of broader surveillance)

---

## Maintenance

### Regular Checks

**Daily:**
- Check email for Canarytoken alerts
- Cross-reference with webhook

**Weekly:**
- Verify bait files still exist on server
- Check they're still accessible (test once/month only)

**Monthly:**
- Review alert history
- Update evidence documentation
- Ensure tokens haven't expired (they don't expire, but check service status)

---

## Troubleshooting

### No Alerts Received

**Possible Reasons:**
- Files haven't been accessed (expected - they're traps)
- Email blocked Canarytoken notification (check spam folder)
- Token configured incorrectly (regenerate if needed)

**Solution:**
- Test token by accessing once yourself (cellular data)
- Verify email received
- If not, regenerate token

### False Alarms

**Possible Causes:**
- You accessed the file
- Legitimate search engine crawler (rare for PDFs/docs)
- Website security scanner

**How to Identify:**
- Check IP address
- Your IP = false alarm (note for records)
- Known crawler = expected (Google, Bing)
- Unknown/government IP = REAL ALERT

---

## Summary

Bait files provide an additional layer of honeypot protection:

1. Generate Canarytokens (PDF, Word docs)
2. Rename to appear as legitimate evidence
3. Upload to website (but don't link publicly)
4. Monitor for alerts
5. Document any unauthorized access
6. Use as evidence in criminal complaints

**Key Advantage:** Impossible to discover without active surveillance, making any access irrefutable proof of unauthorized monitoring.

**REMINDER:** This is confidential operational security information. Handle appropriately.
